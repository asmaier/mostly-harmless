\chapter{Classical mechanics}
In the view of classical mechanics the world consists of point particles with constant mass $m$, 
position $\vec{x(t)}$ and velocity $\vec{v(t)}$. The number of particles is countable 
(not an uncountable infinity) and stays constant. The particles don't split or unite. 
The time is a global parameter which is the same for each particle. This description 
of the world is sometimes also called point mechanics.

It is amazing how many phenomenoms one can describe with this simple model of the world.
On the other side this short description already hints to the several limitations of this model. 
The standard model of physics nowadays based on quantum field theory basically abandons
all the assumptions made by classical mechanics.
