    "We start with a simple equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^2 * 1 = 1 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "What is the transformation A, when applied twice, which turns 1 into 1 ? The answer is simple: $A=1$ or $A=-1$. But what is the transformation $B$, when applied twice, which turns 1 into -1 ?\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B^2 * 1 = -1 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "The answer it turns out, is not so simple. Based on the common rules of multiplication for real numbers, there seems to be no way to solve this equation for $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However there is a way out of the dilemma. The reader might have noticed, that we didn't call $A$ or $B$ a number or a variable, but a transformation. We could have also called it also an operator. This should be a hint, that maybe simple numbers are not enough to solve such an equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's think a bit. Can this equation maybe interpreted in a geometrical way? Let's imagine the line of numbers. What we want is a way, to move or transform the point 1 to the point -1, but doing it with two steps (One step would be simple, this could be reflection at the zero point). If we draw the line on a sheet of paper and look from far away the solution might be become more obvious: The line is embedded on the two dimensional surface of the paper! So we might interpret our source point 1 in fact as a vector (1,0) and our target point -1 as vector (-1,0). Maybe this helps. Let's rewrite our equation in two dimensions\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B^2 * \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "So what we want is a transformation $B$, which when used twice on the vector (1,0) will turn the vector into the vector (-1,0). Vector (-1,0) is pointing into the opposite direction of vector (1,0), so it is basically rotated by 180 degrees. So we are searching for a transformation which rotates a vector in two steps by 180 degrees. Now it should be obvious that the solution for $B$ must be a transformation, which rotates a vector by 90 degrees, in short $B = R(90^{\\circ})$ (or a rotation in the other direction by -90 degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we found a solution by geometrical intuition, let's try to make it precise. From linear algebra we know, that a transformation which turns a 2D vector into another 2D vector must be a 2x2 matrix. So let's rewrite the equation as a matrix equation\n",
