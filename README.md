# Mostly harmless...

Here I'm collecting some mostly harmless notes on physics, mathematics, statistics as Jupyter notebooks.

You can view the notes here: http://asmaier.github.io/mostly-harmless/

**Note**
To convert latex to markdown you can use the custom kramdown lua writer like

    $ pandoc --wrap=preserve --bibliography=promotion.bib --citeproc -t kramdown.lua -o mostly-harmless.md mostly-harmless.tex
