# Mostly harmless...

Here I'm collecting some mostly harmless notes on physics, mathematics, statistics as Jupyter notebooks.

You can view the notes here: http://asmaier.github.io/mostly-harmless/

**Note**
To convert latex to markdown you can use the custom kramdown lua writer like

    $ pandoc -t kramdown.lua vector.tex -o vector.md --wrap=preserve
